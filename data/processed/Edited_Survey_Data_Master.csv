It's not a perfect solution, but the connection to peers and the added level of group or team expectations can be very powerful in forming a teenagers habits.  The added level of role models that exist in the form of coaches, advisors or captains helps tremendously.  Students can see first hand how to stay drug & alcohol free.    Strong relationships between staff and students can be a very effective too!  It's not an organized thing, but in my 25 plus years in education, relationships can be the most powerful prevention tool.  Students that know they are cared about and someone is paying attention are less likely to engage in risky behavior.    Perhaps the most powerful thing I have seen is the ""Every 15 Minutes"" program.  We did it at our school about 6-7 years ago and it may be time to do it again for a new group of students."|While the messages can be powerful in the moment, one and done assemblies are not long term solutions.  Not saying that schools shouldn't do it, because the student bodies need to hear the messages and some of the people involved are very talented public speakers with great messages!

What works for one town, school or community may not work for another.  In some schools, the resource officer is a very powerful position and tool used to prevent substance abuse.  At the same time, many small school and towns can't afford such a position.  Some districts have social workers, some don't.  Some have advisory programs, while others choose not to have them.    Even with the best programs and the best people in place we still experience failure.  Some of that can simply be chalked up to human behavior.

We know that DARE didn't work as hoped and was phased out. We feel a comprehensive approach through school and home is the only way. Parents do not understand that the strength of marijuana is much higher then when they may have used it. There is a prevalent mindset that it's use is ""acceptable"". We are running into parents who do NOT want any consequences for marijuana use! Vapor cigarettes are common and parents are totally unaware of what they look like, how they are used, potential dangers. Then there are the prescription drugs. While parents watch commercials to know they are a danger, they seem to think only other people's kids would do that. Until we change the cultural acceptance of street drugs, it makes it very difficult to battle the drug wars that are alive and well, yet hidden in Maine's high schools.     Our HS staff are well trained. They know what to look for. They take action. Then the action has little results or impact....This problem extends well beyond our schools and we need to start there."|Health class curriculum or lessons woven into other classes|Evening activities, parent education offerings, online education...information sharing||Not sure||No|It has been discussed for elementary level. We want to catch them while parents are still super engaged and willing to learn. It has not happened yet. I'm pretty sure it happens at middle and high school.||||"Personal connections.  Having a 1/1 mentor. Getting a parent, sibling, or other personal role model to stop using and the kid stops. Stopping ACCESS to the drug.      I taught in inner city Las Vegas for a decade during which time I taught a ""Teens, Crime and the Community"" course. We talked a LOT in that curriculum about not using drugs as a therapist to cope with stressful, loveless lives. Every kid just needs to KNOW that one person loves them unconditionally and does not approve of drug use. I have had kids drive back as adults to tell  me that they made it....They wanted me to know that they met my expectations.  I feel as though if every teacher ""adopted"" for lack of a better word, one to two kids at risk for drug use, we would have a good start on tackling this problem for Maine youth.     It seems more difficult to tackle when the community you serve sees it as a taboo topic and won't ""own"" that it's a problem. If we can't name it, we can't fix it. Do Maine educators in general KNOW how serious this is?"|In school education from someone who is not sincere.   Role models using drugs and the community knows it, but then they come to school and preach drug avoidance.   Parental acceptance or promotion of drug use.  Turning the other cheek and sending the message that it is OK! (this happens more than people realize) We need training in how to approach and confront children when adults become aware so that they have some tools...by WE I mean most adults in schools. Custodians and secretaries see the most....they should be trained to take action. (but only if people will actually follow through on their action)|At our school it is addressed through our health curriculum.     I feel that organizations outside school (Scouts, church groups and such) would take an active role if we partnered with them. This is a battle that will only be won from the outside in. How do we get funding to create partnerships with these community entities? We need some media coverage, advertising, and such...people can't fix it if they don't know it's broken.
